1. Download zeppelin binaries (zeppelin-0.7.3-bin-all.tgz) from https://zeppelin.apache.org/download.html
2. Upload the file to edge node in home direcotry
3. use tar to unzip the file (tar -xzvf)
4. cd to conf folder
5. copy zeppelin-env.sh.template to zeppelin-env.sh
6. Give the spark home and hadoop direcotry
export SPARK_HOME=/home/praful/spark-2.1.1-bin-hadoop2.7
export HADOOP_CONF_DIR=/etc/hadoop/conf
7. Specify yarn as the master for job scheduling
export MASTER=yarn-client
8. Copy hive-site.xml from /etc/hive/conf into conf folder
9. Because azure dev is in cloud and ports are not open you need to use ssh tunnel.
10. In zeppelin-site.xml edit property. Give a port like 9097.
<property>
  <name>zeppelin.server.port</name>
  <value>9097</value>
  <description>Server port.</description>
</property>
11. cd into bin folder
12. To start zeppelin service type in ./zeppelin-daemon.sh start. You will see 
Zeppelin start                                             [  OK  ]
13. Using telnet open a tunnel. For this in your telnt session go to change settings
14. Under connections/SSH/tunnels
    Edit Source port as the port you gave in zeppelin-site.xml
    In destinaton give value as localhost:port-number
    Clck Add and then Apply
15. Now you go to localhost:port-number you should see the zeppelin page
16. by default there is no login. But you can set up login in if you like in sitexml.
17. Happy coding
